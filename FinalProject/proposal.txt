1) concrete goals for your project, and methods of testing and verification you will apply to determine whether those goals were met

Create a file server.
- Choose the type of file server (NFS or Samba).
- Choose internal (to AWS) or external file server.
- Make sure it is accessible from other machines (ie mountable),
- Make it secure

2) a discussion of your project's effect on its user population, and the user support issues it might raise

Provide the user population with access to secured shared file storage over the internet or at least within the subdomain.
Issues: adding users, giving users permission to access folders, creating new folders, managing access groups

3) a discussion of security issues relevant to your project

- decide on an authentication method: either username/password or pre-auth
- make sure users can't access each other files unless they are in some general folder, etc
- creating security groups

4) a discussion of the work needed to complete the project and what might be needed to maintain it for continued future use

- make all this happen with a Puppet script, that is long term maintenance more or less
- making sure the project programs are kept up to date, etc

5) documentation of the project, both for the system administration work involved and for your user community

- large part of the admin stuff is the puppet script;
- admin docs: creating users/groups/folders/security
- user docs: how to map/mount the drive, requesting account creation, requesting folder access, putting files on and taking them off the server
