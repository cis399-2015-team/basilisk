# basilisk

Be thou like the imperial basilisk,<br>
Killing thy foe with unapparent wounds!<br>
Gaze on oppression, till at that dread risk,<br>
Aghast she pass from the earthâ€™s disk.<br>
Fear not, but gaze, for freemen mightier grow,<br>
And slaves more feeble, gazing on their foe.<br>

- Percy Bysshe Shelley, in "Ode to Naples"
