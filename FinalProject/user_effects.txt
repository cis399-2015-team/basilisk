2) a discussion of your project's effect on its user population, and the user support issues it might raise

The user population can only access a samba share located on our server from a client on the same subnet. To access a client machine, the user's public key must be added by the administrator via Puppet resources. Once the user is allowed to access the client, an administrator must create a samba user account on the server to allow the user to mount it on their machine. A temporary password will be created for the user to login with and they must change it before the can mount the share.

New shares must be created on the samba server by administrators. Once the specified directory has been created, the administrator has the ability to add or remove any user or group from the directory permissions and setup the client for easy access to the server by modifying the Puppet managed mount resource. The user can then mount the share on the client instance using the command "sudo mount -a". If the user wants to unmount the share, they could use the command "sudo umount -a", however this causes errors to appear. The preferred method is to use, "sudo umount [path/to/folder]". This option does not create any error messages from its use.

Security does not require any extra work from the user, as it is maintained in both the communications between client and server automatically using server signing and on the server itself.
