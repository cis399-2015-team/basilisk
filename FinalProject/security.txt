3) a discussion of security issues relevant to your project

We must establish and maintain an authentication method for users. This could be either username/password or some form of pre-authentication. We must make sure users cannot access each other files unless the files are in some general folder, etc. As was discussed above, we must also create and maintain security groups.

You should also research known security issues with NFS or CIFS
(depending on what you implement) and how to protect access both at the
network level (iptables filtering, network access control in the server)
along with user authentication.
