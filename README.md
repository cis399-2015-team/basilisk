# basilisk

Be thou like the imperial basilisk,
Killing thy foe with unapparent wounds!
Gaze on oppression, till at that dread risk,
Aghast she pass from the earthâ€™s disk.
Fear not, but gaze,- for freemen mightier grow,
And slaves more feeble, gazing on their foe
- Percy Bysshe Shelley, in "Ode to Naples"
