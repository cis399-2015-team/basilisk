Describe the results of testing your load balancer when you shut down one, then both, back-end instances, and when you restore them.

One server down: The loadbalancer still allows the site to load with no problems
Two servers down: Loads no page when requested, times out
One server restarted: The loadbalancer now allows the site to load with no problems
Both servers restarted: The loadbalancer allows the site to load with no problems
