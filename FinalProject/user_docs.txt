# User Documentation

## Creating a user account

Users must contact a server administrators to create a samba account on the file server. A temporary password will be created for the user to login with that they must change before they can mount a share. Once the temporary password has been received the user must change their password with smbpasswd:

sudo smbpasswd -r [server IP] -U [username]


## Creating a shared folder

Shared folders desired by the user must be created on the server by the administrators. Once the specified folder has been created, the admin has the ability to add or remove any user or group from the folder permissions.


## Mounting/unmounting a share

Mount a share with this command:

sudo mount -a

To unmount the share, the preferred method is to issue this command:

sudo umount [/path/to/folder]


## Adding files to folder

Once mounted onto the client, the user can then create, change, and access any files in the shared folder with standard commands for their system.


## Alternative ways to access the shared file system

Users may also access the shares using this command:

smbclient //[server IP]/[share] -U [username]

This method allows the user to navigate and edit the folder in the server itself rather than by mounting the server on the client.


## Additional help

If any of the above mounting, unmounting, or editing of files results in unexpected errors please contact your server administrators.
