5) documentation of the project, both for the system administration work involved and for your user community

A large part of the administrative work is in the Puppet modules. Other administrative documentation includes creating directories, users, groups, and maintaining security.


# System administrator documentation

## Managing shared directories

### Create new shares

To create new shares on the server the administrator must modify smb.conf. This file is managed by Puppet. Each share has a standard setup that looks like this:

[[folder_name]]
path = /home/[user_name]/[folder_name]
available = yes
valid users = [user_name]
read only = no
browseable = yes
public = yes
writable = yes

Path is the path to the shared directory. Valid users can be a username separately created with smbadduser or smbpasswd or a group prefixed by an '@': i.e. @group. Add these shares to the end of the smb.conf file.

After created shares on the server via the Puppet managed smb.conf file in the samba module, you need to add a new mount resource to make it easy for users to mount their shares. This is handled in the smbclient module by a mount resource. You can copy the existing mount and modify its attributes to create additional entries in the client's /etc/fstabs.

### Removing shares

To remove a share simply remove the appropriate section from smb.conf. Afterward the shared folder can also be removed.

Also, remove the corresponding mount resource from the smbclient module.


## Managing Users and Groups on the Server

### Add users

Before users can be added to samba they must first exist on the system. There are a couple ways to add users. These can be created with:

sudo adduser [username]

You will be required to assign and confirm a password, asked to add additional information for the user, and then asked for final confirmation.

### Remove users

To remove no longer necessary user accounts issue this command:

sudo deluser [username]

If you want to remove the home directory along with the user use this command:

sudo deluser --remove-home [username]

### Sudo privileges

If this user needs to manually mount shares themselves they must be added to sudoers. A copy of this file is also managed by the smbclient Puppet module. New users or groups can be added by copying the existing line and changing the initial name to match the user or group.

After a user account is no longer needed or has already been removed always remove the corresponding line from the puppet managed sudoers file.

### Add groups

New groups can be added with this command:

sudo addgroup [group]

Then, a user can be added to an existing group with this command:

sudo adduser [username] [group]

### Add samba users

Once the user account has been created it must be connected with samba. There are a couple ways to add samba users: the standard built-in command or the custom smbadduser script which is maintained by Puppet.

This is the custom command:

sudo smbadduser [username]

This is the standard command:

sudo smbpasswd -a [username]

The smbadduser command adds a samba user with a semi-random password and requires that the user change their password before they can mount a share. It will print out the random password that should be mailed to the user along with instructing them to use this command to change their password:

sudo smbpasswd -r [server IP] -U [username]

Alternately you can use smbpasswd to create the user:

sudo smbpasswd -a [username]

Note: Use '-s' to only modify the user's password.

### Remove samba users

Samba users can be removed using smbpasswd:

sudo smbpasswd -x [username]


## Maintaining security

Throughout all maintenance keeping everything secure is a top priority. This means keeping track of groups and their members to make sure that only approved users and groups have access to the intended shares. Always prefer changing the Puppet modules over editing files on your systems directly. Use private git repositories to keep your configuration secret. Keep track of security updates and always schedule them promptly.
